# Application background

TAKE(read like 'tei-k') is a cell phone manufacturer in South Korea. TAKE LTE(read like 'tei-k el-tee-ee') is an Android-based smartphone. Its OS is Android Jellybean and final update was 4.1.

It has built-in music application. But its Broadcasting intents are not in standard way supported by any other scrobbler apps.

This application takes almost intents from builtin player and re-broadcast into standardized way so that intents of the music player are recognized by all Last.fm scrobbler apps.
